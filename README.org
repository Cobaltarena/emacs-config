* Installation

First, clone this configuration using
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/Cobaltarena/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d/emacs-config
#+end_src
Then open _~/.emacs.d/init.el_ and add the following

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-config
      (expand-file-name "emacs-config/main.org" user-emacs-directory))
(org-babel-load-file org-config)
#+end_src

The first run should take some time since it needs to download and build all
the packages.

* Known issues

** Void function org-file-name-concat
If you encounter an issue about org-file-name-concat being a void function
and if it is related to org-persist with the cache, it means that it is the org-mode
builtin to emacs that is used instead of the official one.
To fix this, add the following to your =init.el=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)

(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (bootstrap-version 5))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
(straight-use-package 'org)
(package-initialize)
#+end_src
